# Minimal requirements for Kaggle notebook
# These are the only packages needed for emergencycarenavigator-agent-capstone.ipynb
# 
# Note: You may see dependency conflict warnings from Kaggle's pre-installed packages
# (bigframes, google-cloud-translate, ray, pydrive2, gcsfs). These can be safely ignored
# as they are not used in our code.

pydantic>=2.5.0
rich>=12.4.4,<14  # Compatible with bigframes requirement
google-generativeai>=0.3.1
